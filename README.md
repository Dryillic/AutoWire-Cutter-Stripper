# AutoWire-Cutter-Stripper

This repository is for documenting the process and project of creating our own automatic wire cutter.
The device will be able to take input from the user regarding wire length, options and number of wires.

The original inspiration for this project came from Reddit user "Maclsk" on the subreddit /r/specializedtools, link here: https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/78wd32/i_made_a_specialized_tool_for_cutting_wire/
Our goal is to create a similar device with autostripping for our workplace.
