# AutoWire-Cutter-Stripper

This repository is for documenting the process and project of creating our own automatic wire cutter/stripper.
The device will be able to take input from the user regarding wire length, stripping options and number of wires.

The original inspiration for this project came from "Maclsk" on the subreddit /r/electronics, link here: https://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/791war/i_just_made_an_fm_radio_with_two_transistors/?ref=share&ref_source=link
Our goal is to create a similar device with autostripping for our workplace.
